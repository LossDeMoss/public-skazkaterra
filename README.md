# Skazkaterra Startup

## ViewPagerListener
Cool ViewPagerListener I wrote for a custom ViewPager in SkazkaTerra.
This listener changes the color of the page depending on the degree
of scrolling.

This piece of code is memorable for me because it was a first time i used bitwise operators in my production and it went so smoothe.

## PlayingService
Android Service I wrote to stream music by link. Service supports 
progress bar I/O and avoids becoming noisy (headphones jack / bluetooth management)
